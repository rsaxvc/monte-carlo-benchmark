Version2:
	Use better PRNG
		Don't use BBS - skews results if int-divide instruction available.
		Take in current state as argument, return next state, like raw BBS.
		Inline-able.

	Do all math with integers
		Current benchmark performs very differently if FPU enabled or not.

	Counting from 1 to 100 threads doesn't seem terribly useful above 10
	powers of 2:[1 to 128] should work fine.

	Each test needs to be run multiple times, with min/avg/max recorded

	Should also record
		userspace time vs kernel time
		context switches

	Need more automated logging of:
		uname -a
		cat /proc/cpuinfo or equivalent
		compiler version
		pthreads version
		clibrary version
